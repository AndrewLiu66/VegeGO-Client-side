# VegeGO

This is my personal project that's built mainly with the web framework Vue.js. It mocks a grocery store that sells fruits.
Users are able to pick a store, add items into store, and place orders.

The web only serves well in mobile size screen, please change your browser viewport into ###### mobile size before viewing the Web App
