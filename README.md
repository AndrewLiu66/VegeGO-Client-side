## Project Intro

This is my personal project that's built mainly with the web framework Vue.js. It mocks a grocery store that sells fruits.
Users are able to pick a store, add items into store, and place orders.

The web only serves well in mobile size screen, please change your browser viewport into ***mobile size*** before viewing the Web App

## Project setup
```
